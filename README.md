Working Principle of ACS712 Current Sensor with Arduino
The ACS712 sensor operates on the Hall-effect principle. When current flows through the input terminals (IP+ and IP-), it generates a magnetic field proportional to the current. The integrated Hall sensor detects this magnetic field and produces a corresponding voltage at the VOUT pin.
1.	Output Voltage:
o	At zero current, the output voltage is approximately 2.5V (midpoint of the supply voltage).
o	For positive currents, the voltage increases above 2.5V.
o	For negative currents, the voltage decreases below 2.5V.
2.	Measuring Current:
o	Using the Arduino's ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), the output voltage of the ACS712 is read and converted to a digital value. The current is then calculated using the formula:

2.	Add a Capacitor:
o	Use an external capacitor on the filter pin to reduce noise (e.g., 0.1 µF).
3.	Avoid Overcurrent:
o	Ensure the current does not exceed the sensor's maximum rating.
